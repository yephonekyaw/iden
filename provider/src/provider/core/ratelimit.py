"""Fixed-window rate limiting, in Redis.

Argon2 makes a password guess expensive for *the server*, not for the attacker.
Without a limit, `/api/v1/auth/login` is both a brute-force target and a way to
exhaust the machine's CPU with a few hundred requests.

**Deliberately per-route rather than global middleware.** A blanket cap in
front of every endpoint would either be too loose to stop credential stuffing
or too tight for a dashboard that legitimately makes many calls. A global cap
against crude flooding belongs in the reverse proxy — nginx's `limit_req` is
better placed for it, because it can refuse the connection before Python is
involved at all.

Fixed windows, not sliding: a counter and an expiry, one round trip. The cost
is that an attacker can spend a full allowance at the very end of one window
and again at the start of the next. For the limits here — a handful of attempts
per minute — that doubling changes nothing about whether guessing works.
