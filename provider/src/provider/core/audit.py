"""Append-only record of every state-changing request.

Written from a session of its own after the response has been produced: the
request's own transaction has already committed by then, so the audit row and
the change it describes cannot be atomic. A failed write is logged loudly
rather than swallowed — see KI-17 in PLAN.md.

Pure ASGI rather than a `@app.middleware("http")` function: the request body is
part of what makes an entry worth reading, and reading it from inside a
BaseHTTPMiddleware consumes the stream the endpoint is about to read.
