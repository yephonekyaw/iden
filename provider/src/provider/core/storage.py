"""Blob storage, spoken as S3.

The provider targets the S3 API rather than any one implementation, so the
store behind `IDEN_S3_ENDPOINT_URL` can be SeaweedFS (what the dev compose
runs), MinIO, Garage, or AWS S3 itself without a line of this changing.

Profile photos are the first user; the biometric module's enrollment images are
the reason the abstraction is worth having at all.
