"""Turning a User-Agent header into something a person recognises.

Deliberately a short table rather than a parser library. The regex databases
those ship go stale, and updating one becomes a reason to redeploy the
provider — for a field whose only job is to help someone spot the session that
is not theirs. A short list that degrades to `None` is better than a long one
that is confidently wrong.

Best effort is the contract: every return is nullable, and a browser IDEN has
never heard of shows as an unnamed session rather than a broken row.
