"""Throw the development database away and build it again.

    uv run python -m scripts.reset         # asks first
    uv run python -m scripts.reset --yes   # does not

Four steps, because a reset that does fewer leaves something behind: drop the
schema, flush Redis, migrate, seed. Redis is the one people forget — sessions
outlive the rows they refer to, so a database-only reset leaves live cookies
naming users that no longer exist, and the next request fails in a way that
looks like a bug rather than a stale login.
