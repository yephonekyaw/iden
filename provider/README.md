# IDEN Provider

The IDEN backend: a single FastAPI application that is simultaneously an **OpenID Connect provider**
and an **access-control service**. This document is the reference — setup, configuration, data model,
endpoints, tokens, and conventions. For the *order of work*, see [PLAN.md](PLAN.md). For the
system-level picture (Docker topology, frontends, kiosks), see the [root README](../README.md).

One process hosts four logical modules:

| Module | Prefix | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **AuthZ Server** | `/.well-known/*`, `/oauth2/*`, `/api/v1/auth/*` | Issues tokens. Owns login, consent, sessions, and the OIDC protocol surface. |
| **Admin RS** | `/admin/*` | Manages users, groups, roles, APIs, scopes, and clients. |
| **Entity RS** | `/entity/*` | Self-service for the signed-in person. |
| **Biometric RS** | `/biometric/*` | Face enrollment and verification. Mounted only when enabled. |

They are **logical** modules, not services: one port, one image, one deployable. Because they share a
process, the resource-server modules verify access tokens in-process against the same keys the AuthZ
module signed them with — no introspection hop. Resource servers *outside* this repository get the
same guarantee by validating against the published JWKS.

## Local Development

Python 3.14+, managed by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), plus PostgreSQL with `pgvector` and Redis:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d    # postgres:18 + pgvector, redis:8
```

Then, from the repository root:

```bash
cd provider
uv sync                              # install dependencies into .venv
cp .env.example .env                 # then fill it in

uv run python -m scripts.gen_keys    # RSA signing keypair for local dev
uv run alembic upgrade head          # pgvector extension + every table
uv run python -m scripts.seed        # system catalogue, bootstrap admin and clients

uv run provider                      # uvicorn on :8000, reload enabled
```

Then:

- Interactive API docs — <http://localhost:8000/docs>
- Discovery — <http://localhost:8000/.well-known/openid-configuration>
- Health — <http://localhost:8000/health>

**Adding a dependency:** `uv add <package>` from `provider/`. Never hand-edit the `pyproject.toml`
dependency list — `uv` owns it and the lockfile.

**Running the tests:**

```bash
uv run pytest                             # 224 tests, ~12s
uv run pytest tests/test_scope_resolver.py -q
```

They use their own `iden_test` database (created and dropped per run) and Redis logical database 15,
so they never touch your development data. The app is driven in-process over ASGI — no server to
start. See [PLAN.md § Testing](PLAN.md#testing) for how the fixtures work.

**After changing a model:**

```bash
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "what changed"   # then read it
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

Read what autogenerate produced before applying it. It is reliable for added tables and columns, and
unreliable for anything it has to infer — a renamed column looks like a drop plus an add, and losing
the data in it is silent. Server defaults and `CHECK` constraints are often missed entirely.

`tests/test_migrations.py` fails if the models and the migrations disagree, so a forgotten revision
surfaces in the suite rather than at deployment. The test database is built by running the
migrations, which is the same path a deployment takes.

If your development database predates Alembic, it already has the Phase 2 tables — record that fact
rather than rebuilding it, then apply everything added since:

```bash
uv run alembic stamp 582ce19a8898    # the initial revision; those tables already exist
uv run alembic upgrade head          # audit_events and anything after it
uv run python -m scripts.seed        # pick up newly catalogued scopes
```

Stamping `head` instead would claim every revision is applied and leave the tables they create
missing.

The seed is still idempotent and still safe to re-run; it just no longer creates anything structural.

The seed prints the bootstrap administrator's password and the kiosk client's secret **once**. They
are argon2-hashed on the way into the database and cannot be recovered afterwards — losing them means
re-seeding into a fresh database.

## Configuration

All settings are environment variables prefixed `IDEN_`, loaded by `core/config.py` via
`pydantic-settings` from the process environment or `.env`.

### Application

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `IDEN_ENV` | `dev` | `dev` or `prod`. Selects console vs JSON log rendering. |
| `IDEN_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Root log level. |
| `IDEN_API_PREFIX` | *(empty)* | Optional prefix applied to every mounted router. |
| `IDEN_ALLOWED_ADMIN_ORIGINS` | `[]` | CORS allow-list for the dashboard SPA. |

### Issuer & UI

| Variable | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `IDEN_ISSUER` | `http://localhost:8000` | The `iss` claim and the base for every advertised endpoint and system audience. Must match exactly what clients use, or signature validation succeeds and issuer validation fails. |
| `IDEN_AUTH_UI_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:4000` | Where `/oauth2/authorize` redirects for login and consent. |

### Storage

| Variable | Example |
|---|---|
| `IDEN_DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql+asyncpg://iden:iden@localhost:5432/iden` |
| `IDEN_REDIS_URL` | `redis://localhost:6379/0` |

### Crypto

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `IDEN_SIGNING_KEY_DIR` | `./keys` | Directory of PEM keypairs. Each file's stem becomes its `kid`, which is what makes rotation a config change rather than a rewrite. |
| `IDEN_SIGNING_ALGORITHM` | `RS256` | JWT signing algorithm. |

### Lifetimes

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `IDEN_ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL` | `600` (10 min) | Short on purpose — permission changes take effect at the next issuance. |
| `IDEN_ID_TOKEN_TTL` | `600` | |
| `IDEN_REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL` | `2592000` (30 d) | Sliding; rotated on every use. |
| `IDEN_AUTH_CODE_TTL` | `60` | Single use. |
| `IDEN_SESSION_TTL` | `86400` (24 h) | Sliding browser session. |
| `IDEN_CHALLENGE_TTL` | `600` | Login/consent challenges. |

### Bootstrap & extensions

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `IDEN_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` | `admin@localhost` | Seeded administrator. |
| `IDEN_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | *(generated)* | Generated and printed once if unset. |
| `IDEN_BIOMETRIC_ENABLED` | `false` | Mounts `/biometric/*`, seeds the biometric API and scopes, and registers the `face` auth method. |
| `IDEN_ENGINE_BASE_URL` | `http://engine:8000` | Internal biometric engine. Only read when biometric is enabled. |

### The feature-package rule

Every resource directory contains exactly four files, each with one job:

| File | Contains | Must not contain |
|---|---|---|
| `routes.py` | FastAPI handlers, OpenAPI metadata, translation of domain exceptions into `HTTPException` | Database calls |
| `schemas.py` | Pydantic request/response DTOs and their validation | Business rules |
| `service.py` | Database and domain logic, raising exceptions from `errors.py` | Any FastAPI import |
| `errors.py` | Domain exceptions | Anything else |

The point of `service.py` being FastAPI-free is that domain logic stays testable and reusable —
`scope_resolver.py` is called from three different modules precisely because it knows nothing about
HTTP.

This is the layout described in [`CODING_STYLE.md` § 1](../CODING_STYLE.md#1-project-structure) and
`.claude/CLAUDE.md`; the directories above are its concrete form for this service.

## Data Model

One source of truth: `shared/models.py`, SQLAlchemy 2.0 async ORM. Sessions, challenges, and the
`jti` denylist deliberately live in Redis with TTLs rather than in Postgres — they are ephemeral by
nature and expiry should be the storage layer's job, not a cleanup cron's.

### Invariants worth knowing

| Invariant | Why |
|---|---|
| `is_system` rows cannot be renamed or deleted through the API | An admin deleting `admin:roles:write` would lock the organization out of its own deployment, permanently. |
| Authorization codes, refresh tokens, and client secrets are stored **hashed** | A database read must never yield a usable credential. Same reasoning as passwords. |
| `RefreshToken.family_id` + `rotated_to_id` | Rotation with reuse detection: presenting an already-rotated token revokes the whole family, on the assumption it was stolen. |
| `Scope.description` is required | It is the sentence a user reads on the consent screen. An undescribed permission is one nobody can consent to meaningfully. |
| `RefreshToken` carries `acr` and `amr` | A refreshed token must report the same authentication event as the original login, and the login is not repeated on refresh. `acr` is still derived from `amr` — this just remembers which methods were used. |
| `ProfileField.user_writable` defines the self-service surface | `PATCH /entity/profile` has no fixed field list — it accepts exactly the fields an admin marked writable. `student_id` belongs to the registrar; `preferred_name` belongs to the student. Same table, same endpoint, opposite permissions. |
| Profile values live in a table, not a JSONB column | `unique` on `student_id` has to be a database constraint — a check-then-write in the service layer races. Filtering by field stays an indexed query, and renaming a field key rewrites one row instead of every profile. |
| Scope values are globally unique | A token carries scopes as bare strings and the audience is resolved from the value, so two APIs sharing a value would blend their audiences into one token. Namespace by API: `attendance:records:read`. |
| Groups do not nest | Recursive resolution is hard to explain, hard to audit, and hard to make fast. Flat membership covers the real cases. |
| No `tenant_id` on any table | IDEN is single-organization by design — see the [root README](../README.md#single-organization-by-design). |
| `AuditEvent.actor_user_id` is `ON DELETE SET NULL` | Deleting a user must not erase the record of what they did. `actor_label` keeps their email as it was, so the row still names someone after the account is gone. |

## Access Control in Practice

### The model in one line

```text
User ──┬── direct scope grants (exceptions)
       ├── direct roles ─────────┐
       └── groups ── group roles ┴──> Role ──> Scopes ──> owned by an API (audience)
```

`effective_user_scopes` is the union of all three sources, computed by
`authz/services/scope_resolver.py` — the single implementation used by token issuance
(`/oauth2/token`), by the admin provenance endpoint (`/admin/users/{id}/effective-scopes`), and by
self-service (`/entity/permissions`).

### What actually lands in a token

| Grant | Formula |
|---|---|
| `authorization_code` | `requested ∩ client.grantable_scopes ∩ effective_user_scopes` |
| `client_credentials` | `requested ∩ client.granted_scopes` |

Pruning is **silent** — asking for more than you hold yields a narrower token, not an error. That is
what allows the dashboard SPA to request a broad scope set at `/authorize` and still behave correctly
for a non-admin user.

Permissions are evaluated **at issuance, never at the resource server**. A resource server verifies
the signature, checks `aud`, and reads `scope`. It never looks up a user, a role, or a group. The
corollary: revoking a role takes effect at the next token issuance, which is why access tokens live
for ten minutes.

### System scope catalogue

Seeded by `scripts/seed.py` from `shared/scopes.py`, all flagged `is_system`.

**API `admin`** — audience `{IDEN_ISSUER}/admin`

| Scope | Allows |
|---|---|
| `admin:users:read` / `admin:users:write` | View / manage users, their roles, and direct grants |
| `admin:groups:read` / `admin:groups:write` | View / manage groups, membership, and group roles |
| `admin:roles:read` / `admin:roles:write` | View / manage roles and their scope bundles |
| `admin:apis:read` / `admin:apis:write` | View / manage registered resource APIs |
| `admin:scopes:read` / `admin:scopes:write` | View / manage scopes under an API |
| `admin:clients:read` / `admin:clients:write` | View / manage OAuth clients and their secrets |
| `admin:audit:read` | Read the audit log. No write scope exists — see below |
| `admin:profile-fields:read` / `admin:profile-fields:write` | View / define the organization's profile fields |

**API `entity`** — audience `{IDEN_ISSUER}/entity`

| Scope | Allows |
|---|---|
| `entity:profile:read` / `entity:profile:write` | Read / update my own profile |
| `entity:credentials:write` | Change my own password |
| `entity:totp:read` / `entity:totp:enroll` | View / enrol and remove my TOTP credential |
| `entity:sessions:read` / `entity:sessions:revoke` | List / revoke my active sessions |
| `entity:connections:read` / `entity:connections:revoke` | See / withdraw the applications I have granted access to |
| `entity:permissions:read` | See my own roles, groups, and effective scopes |

**API `biometric`** — audience `{IDEN_ISSUER}/biometric`, seeded only when `IDEN_BIOMETRIC_ENABLED`

| Scope | Allows |
|---|---|
| `biometric:enroll` | Enrol a face template |
| `biometric:verify` | 1:1 verification against a claimed identity |
| `biometric:search` | 1:N identification (the kiosk's "who is this?") |
| `biometric:liveness` | Liveness check only |

**Seeded roles:** `administrator` (all `admin:*` and `entity:*`) and `member` (all `entity:*`).

### Adding a permission to your own API

The flow the whole design exists to support — no code changes, no redeploy:

1. `POST /admin/apis` — register the API with its audience URI (once).
2. `POST /admin/apis/{id}/scopes` — define `attendance:records:read` with a description.
3. `PUT /admin/roles/{id}/scopes` — bundle it into `attendance-officer`.
4. `PUT /admin/groups/{id}/roles` — give the role to the *Registrar* group.
5. `PUT /admin/clients/{id}/scopes` — allow the calling client to request it.

The next token minted for anyone in that group carries the scope, with `aud` set to the API's
audience. Your resource server validates it against `/.well-known/jwks.json` and needs to know
nothing else about IDEN.

## The Audit Log

Every state-changing request writes one row to `audit_events`. There is no way to turn it off and no
endpoint that writes to it — the request being recorded is the only author.

**What counts as state-changing:** any non-`GET` request to `/admin/*`, `/entity/*`,
`/api/v1/auth/*`, or `/oauth2/revoke`, plus `GET /oauth2/logout` — RP-initiated logout is a `GET` by
specification and still destroys a session. Reads are not recorded: an audit log nobody can read
through is one nobody reads, and `GET` volume would bury the writes.

`POST /oauth2/token` is deliberately excluded. A refresh happens every few minutes for every active
session, and the login that authorised it is already in the log.

**What a row holds:**

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `action` | Method plus **route template** — `POST /admin/users/{user_id}/roles`. The template groups; the resolved path would not. |
| `target` | The last path parameter, which is the object being acted on: in `/admin/apis/{api_id}/scopes/{scope_id}` that is the scope. |
| `status_code` | Refused attempts are recorded too. A wall of `403`s from one actor is the signal you want. |
| `actor_user_id` / `actor_label` / `actor_client` | Who, by id, by email-at-the-time, and through which OAuth client. |
| `ip` | The socket peer. `X-Forwarded-For`, if present, goes in `detail` — a header the client sets is a claim, not an observation. |
| `detail` | The request body with secrets redacted, plus the path parameters. |

**Secrets never land in it.** Keys named `password`, `clientSecret`, `token`, `code`, `codeVerifier`
and friends are replaced with `[redacted]` before the row is built, compared with punctuation
stripped so `client_secret` and `clientSecret` are the same key. Only JSON bodies under 4 KB are
captured at all.

**Where it is written.** `core/audit.py`, as pure ASGI middleware rather than a
`@app.middleware("http")` function — reading the request body inside a `BaseHTTPMiddleware` consumes
the stream the endpoint is about to read. The actor comes from `set_actor()`, called by
`require_scope` for token-authenticated routes and by the login and consent steps, which know who the
person is before any token exists.

**One limitation to know about.** The row is written after the response, from a session of its own,
so it is not atomic with the change it describes: if the database becomes unreachable in between, the
change stands and the record is lost. The failure is logged at `error` level rather than swallowed.
Tracked as KI-17 in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md#known-issues).

Read it with `GET /admin/audit`, newest first, filtered by `actorUserId`, `action` (substring),
`since`, and `until`.

## Endpoint Reference

`Auth` column: **public** = no credentials; **client** = client authentication; **bearer** = access
token with the named scope; **session** = browser session cookie. `Phase` refers to [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

### AuthZ — discovery & OAuth

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/.well-known/openid-configuration` | public | Provider metadata; `scopes_supported` is read live from the database | 1 |
| `GET` | `/.well-known/jwks.json` | public | Public signing keys, one JWK per `kid` | 1 |
| `GET` | `/oauth2/authorize` | session | Start authorization code + PKCE; redirects to `auth-ui` when login or consent is needed. Gains `prompt`, `max_age`, `login_hint`, `id_token_hint` | 1, 3 |
| `POST` | `/oauth2/token` | client | `authorization_code`, `refresh_token`, `client_credentials` | 1 |
| `GET` | `/oauth2/userinfo` | bearer `openid` | Claims filtered by granted scopes | 1 |
| `POST` | `/oauth2/revoke` | client | RFC 7009 — revoke a refresh family or denylist a `jti`. Public clients may revoke their own tokens | 1 |
| `POST` | `/oauth2/introspect` | client | RFC 7662 — **confidential clients only**: the response describes someone else's token, and a `client_id` is public by definition | 1 |
| `GET` | `/oauth2/logout` | session | End session, honour `post_logout_redirect_uri`. Gains `id_token_hint` and the back-channel fan-out | 1, 3 |

### AuthZ — login & consent (consumed by `auth-ui`)

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/v1/auth/challenge/{id}` | public | Pending client name + requested scopes, for rendering the page | 1 |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/login` | public | Password login; appends `pwd` to the session `amr` | 1 |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/totp` | session | TOTP verification / step-up; appends `otp` | 1 |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/biometric` | session | Face login; appends `face`. `501` unless biometric is enabled | 1 stub / 4 |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/consent` | session | Persist or deny a consent grant, then resume `/authorize` | 1 |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/password-reset` | public | Begin recovery. Always `202`, even for an unknown address — a different answer would enumerate accounts | 4 |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/password-reset/confirm` | public | Single-use token, 15-minute TTL; revokes every session and refresh token on success | 4 |

Login returns `complete` with a `resumeUrl`, or `totpRequired` when the client asked for an
assurance level a password alone does not reach. It never reports `consentRequired`: consent is
decided by `/authorize`, which is the only endpoint that knows the full picture, and the browser
reaches it again by following `resumeUrl`.

### Admin RS

| Method | Path | Scope | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` `POST` | `/admin/apis` | `admin:apis:read` / `:write` | 2 |
| `GET` `PATCH` `DELETE` | `/admin/apis/{id}` | `admin:apis:read` / `:write` | 2 |
| `GET` `POST` | `/admin/apis/{api_id}/scopes` | `admin:scopes:read` / `:write` | 2 |
| `GET` `PATCH` `DELETE` | `/admin/scopes/{id}` | `admin:scopes:read` / `:write` | 2 |
| `GET` `POST` | `/admin/roles` | `admin:roles:read` / `:write` | 2 |
| `GET` `PATCH` `DELETE` | `/admin/roles/{id}` | `admin:roles:read` / `:write` | 2 |
| `GET` `PUT` | `/admin/roles/{id}/scopes` | `admin:roles:read` / `:write` | 2 |
| `GET` `POST` | `/admin/groups` | `admin:groups:read` / `:write` | 2 |
| `GET` `PATCH` `DELETE` | `/admin/groups/{id}` | `admin:groups:read` / `:write` | 2 |
| `PUT` | `/admin/groups/{id}/roles` | `admin:groups:write` | 2 |
| `GET` `POST` `DELETE` | `/admin/groups/{id}/members` | `admin:groups:read` / `:write` | 2 |
| `GET` `POST` | `/admin/users` | `admin:users:read` / `:write` | 2 |
| `GET` `PATCH` `DELETE` | `/admin/users/{id}` | `admin:users:read` / `:write` | 2 |
| `PUT` | `/admin/users/{id}/roles` | `admin:users:write` | 2 |
| `PUT` | `/admin/users/{id}/scopes` | `admin:users:write` | 2 |
| `POST` | `/admin/users/{id}/reset-password` | `admin:users:write` | 2 |
| `GET` | `/admin/users/{id}/effective-scopes` | `admin:users:read` | 2 |
| `GET` `POST` | `/admin/clients` | `admin:clients:read` / `:write` | 2 |
| `GET` `PATCH` `DELETE` | `/admin/clients/{id}` | `admin:clients:read` / `:write` | 2 |
| `POST` | `/admin/clients/{id}/rotate-secret` | `admin:clients:write` | 2 |
| `PUT` | `/admin/clients/{id}/scopes` | `admin:clients:write` | 2 |
| `GET` | `/admin/audit` | `admin:audit:read` | 2 |
| `GET` `POST` | `/admin/profile-fields` | `admin:profile-fields:read` / `:write` | 4 |
| `GET` `PATCH` `DELETE` | `/admin/profile-fields/{id}` | `admin:profile-fields:read` / `:write` | 4 |

`PUT` on a relationship (`.../roles`, `.../scopes`) **replaces the whole set** rather than adding to
it. Set semantics make the endpoint idempotent and the dashboard's editing UI trivial.

### Entity RS

Every route derives the user from the token's `sub` and never accepts a user id from the caller.

| Method | Path | Scope | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` `PATCH` | `/entity/profile` | `entity:profile:read` / `:write` | 4 |
| `GET` | `/entity/profile/schema` | `entity:profile:read` | 4 |
| `POST` | `/entity/credentials/password` | `entity:credentials:write` + fresh auth | 4 |
| `POST` | `/entity/credentials/email` | `entity:credentials:write` + fresh auth | 4 |
| `POST` | `/entity/totp/enroll` · `/entity/totp/confirm` | `entity:totp:enroll` | 4 |
| `GET` `DELETE` | `/entity/totp` | `entity:totp:read` / `:enroll` | 4 |
| `GET` | `/entity/sessions` | `entity:sessions:read` | 4 |
| `DELETE` | `/entity/sessions/{id}` | `entity:sessions:revoke` | 4 |
| `GET` `DELETE` | `/entity/connections` | `entity:connections:read` / `:revoke` | 4 |
| `GET` | `/entity/permissions` | `entity:permissions:read` | 4 |

Sensitive routes are additionally gated by `require_fresh_auth(max_age=300)`: a valid access token is
not enough to change a password or remove a second factor, because an attacker holding a stolen
token would otherwise take over the account outright. They must pass a login they cannot complete.

### Biometric RS — mounted only when `IDEN_BIOMETRIC_ENABLED=true`

| Method | Path | Scope | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/biometric/enroll` | `biometric:enroll` | 5 |
| `POST` | `/biometric/verify` | `biometric:verify` | 5 |
| `POST` | `/biometric/search` | `biometric:search` | 5 |
| `POST` | `/biometric/liveness` | `biometric:liveness` | 5 |

## Tokens & Claims

| Token | Format | Lifetime | Storage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Access | Signed JWT (`RS256`) | 10 min | Stateless; early revocation via a Redis `jti` denylist |
| ID | Signed JWT (`RS256`) | 10 min | Stateless; identity claims only, never sent to an API |
| Refresh | Opaque random string | 30 days, sliding | Hashed in Postgres, rotated on every use, reuse revokes the family. Its stored `scope` is the **original grant**; a `scope` parameter narrows one response without shrinking it |
| Authorization code | Opaque random string | 60 s, single use | Hashed in Postgres, bound to `client_id` + `code_challenge` |

### Access token claims

| Claim | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `iss` | `IDEN_ISSUER` |
| `sub` | User id — or the client id for `client_credentials`, where no person is involved |
| `aud` | Audience of the API owning the granted scopes; a list when scopes span several APIs |
| `client_id` | The client that requested the token |
| `scope` | Space-delimited granted scopes, already pruned |
| `acr` / `amr` | Assurance level and the methods actually used |
| `jti` | Unique id — the handle used for revocation |
| `iat` / `exp` | Issued-at and expiry |

### `amr` and `acr`

`amr` accumulates on the **session** as the user authenticates; `acr` is **derived from `amr` at
issuance time and never stored**. One source of truth means a mid-session step-up automatically
upgrades the next token, with no state to keep in sync.

| `amr` | Method | | `acr` | Requires |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pwd` | Password | | `iden:loa:1` | Any single factor |
| `otp` | TOTP | | `iden:loa:2` | Any two factors |
| `face` | Liveness-verified face match | | `iden:loa:3` | `face` plus one more factor |
| `mfa` | Added whenever two or more were used | | | |

A client requests a minimum with `acr_values=iden:loa:2` at `/authorize`; if the session falls short,
IDEN forces a step-up before issuing the code.

Each method is registered in `authz/services/auth_methods.py`. That registry is the seam that lets
the biometric module add `face` without the AuthZ core knowing anything about faces.

### Validating an IDEN token from your own resource server

1. Fetch and cache `{issuer}/.well-known/jwks.json`; select the key by the token header's `kid`.
2. Verify the signature, then `iss`, `exp`, and — critically — that `aud` contains **your** API's
   audience. Skipping the `aud` check means accepting a token minted for a different service.
3. Check that the required scope is present in `scope`.
4. Do not look up the user. Everything you are authorized to know is in the token.

## Request Lifecycle

Where a request goes, and which file owns each step:

```text
nginx
  → core/app.py            request-id + structlog binding
  → rate limiter           Redis fixed window                       (Phase 6)
  → CORS / security headers
  → routes.py              validate the request body via schemas.py
      · resource server?   core/auth.require_scope(...)
                           verify signature + iss + aud + exp
                           reject denylisted jti  → 401
                           check required scope   → 403
      · authz endpoint?    session_store / challenge_store
  → service.py             DB work via DBSessionDep; raises domain errors
  → routes.py              domain error → HTTPException
  → core/errors.py         → the documented JSON error shape
```

`401` versus `403` is a deliberate distinction: `401` means *authenticate again*, `403` means
*authentication will not help — you lack the scope*.

---

## Conventions

Beyond `CODING_STYLE.md`, which applies in full:

### Every endpoint documents itself

`/docs` is the contract the frontends are built against, so an endpoint that is not self-explanatory
there is not finished:

```python
@router.post(
    "",
    response_model=ScopeResponse,
    status_code=201,
    summary="Create a scope",
    description=(
        "Defines a new permission under the given API.\n\n"
        "**Required scope:** `admin:scopes:write`"
    ),
    responses={
        404: {"description": "API not found"},
        409: {"description": "A scope with this value already exists for the API"},
    },
    dependencies=[Depends(require_scope("admin:scopes:write"))],
)
```

Rules: explicit `response_model` (never inferred from the return type), explicit `status_code` for
non-200 successes (`201` create, `204` delete), `summary` and `description` always, `responses` for
every documented non-2xx, `tags` on the router, `Field(description=...)` on non-obvious fields, and
`Literal[...]` for enums so allowed values show up in the docs.

### Tests belong to the phase that adds the code

Pure logic gets unit tests with no database and no fixtures — the scope resolver, PKCE, and acr
derivation are the highest value per line in the suite. Every endpoint gets at least a success case,
an authorization failure, and its most interesting failure mode. A test name should state the rule
being enforced (`test_reuse_revokes_the_whole_family`), not the mechanics.

### Query parameters are camelCase too

FastAPI does not apply Pydantic's alias generator to query parameters, so multi-word ones need an
explicit alias: `Query(None, alias="groupId")`. Without it a caller sending `groupId` gets an
unfiltered list rather than an error — a filter that quietly returns everything is worse than one
that fails.

### Loading relationships on new objects

A freshly constructed model has its relationships *unset*, not empty. Reading one after `commit()`
triggers a lazy load, which fails inside async code with an unhelpful greenlet error. Either assign
the related object you already have, or `await session.refresh(obj)` before returning it. This is
the single most common way to break an async SQLAlchemy route here.

### Layers

`routes.py` never touches the database. `service.py` never imports FastAPI. Domain exceptions are
raised in services and translated in routes — that is the only place `HTTPException` appears.

### Secrets

All password and client-secret hashing goes through `core/security.py` (argon2id). Cleartext secrets
are returned **once**, on create and on rotate, and are never stored or logged.

### Logging

Use the configured structlog logger, never `print()`. Every log line already carries a `request_id`
from the middleware. Log identifiers, not payloads — never a password, token, secret, or face image.

### Errors

One JSON error shape everywhere, except the OAuth endpoints, which must keep the RFC 6749 format
(`error`, `error_description`) or clients will not understand them.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| `invalid_client` on `/oauth2/token` | `client_id` unknown, wrong secret, or the client is not allowed that grant. Check `allowed_grants`. |
| `invalid_grant` with a fresh code | The code expired (60 s), was already used, `redirect_uri` differs from the authorize request, or the PKCE verifier does not match. |
| Token validates but the resource server rejects it | Almost always `aud`. The scopes granted belong to a different API than the one being called. |
| Signature verification fails after a restart | `gen_keys` regenerated the keypair. Tokens signed with the old key are unverifiable; re-authenticate. |
| `403` on an `/admin/*` route with a valid token | The user's roles do not include that scope, or the client's grantable set does not, so it was pruned at issuance. Check `/admin/users/{id}/effective-scopes`. |
| `401` where you expected `403` | The token is for a different API. Audience is validated before scopes, so a token carrying only `entity:*` gets `401` at an `/admin/*` route — not `403`. `403` means right audience, missing scope. |
| Scope changes have no effect | Access tokens live 10 minutes. Refresh, or wait for expiry. |
| `409` deleting a scope or role | Either it is `is_system` (seeded entries are immutable by design), or it is still granted to someone — pass `force=true` once revoking those permissions is the intent. |
| A filter seems to be ignored | Query parameters are camelCase (`?groupId=`, `?isActive=`). An unrecognised one is dropped, and you get an unfiltered list. |
| `MissingGreenlet` in a route | A relationship was read on a newly created object. Assign it explicitly or `await session.refresh(obj)` after commit. |
| `/biometric/*` returns 404 | `IDEN_BIOMETRIC_ENABLED` is false, so the module is not mounted. |
