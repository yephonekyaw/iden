# Errors

Two shapes, because two audiences.

## IDEN's own shape

Everywhere except the OAuth endpoints:

```json
{
  "code": "field_not_writable",
  "message": "This field belongs to the organization, not to you. An administrator sets it.",
  "details": {"field": "student_id"}
}
```

`code` is stable and safe to branch on. `message` is written for a person and may change.

Every refusal outside `/oauth2/*` uses it — including the ones that come from the framework rather
than from a route. A missing token, an unrouted path, and a malformed body all arrive in this shape.
A validation failure names the fields:

```json
{
  "code": "validation_error",
  "message": "The request is invalid.",
  "details": {"fields": [{"field": "body.audience", "message": "Field required"}]}
}
```

## The OAuth shape

`/oauth2/token`, `/revoke`, `/introspect`, and error redirects from `/authorize` use the format fixed
by [RFC 6749 §5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-5.2), because a client library will
not understand anything else:

```json
{"error": "invalid_grant", "error_description": "Unknown or expired refresh token."}
```

A malformed request to these endpoints — a missing `grant_type`, say — comes back as
`invalid_request` in the same shape, never as IDEN's validation error. A client library reading
§5.2 has no way to read anything else.

Errors from `/authorize` arrive as query parameters on your redirect URI, not as a response body —
unless `client_id` or `redirect_uri` was itself invalid, in which case IDEN answers with JSON rather
than redirecting somewhere it has not verified.

## Statuses

| Status | Means |
|---|---|
| `400` | Malformed, or an invalid grant. |
| `401` | *Authenticate again* — missing, expired, revoked, or wrong-audience token. |
| `403` | *Authenticating will not help* — a valid token without the permission. Also freshness refusals. |
| `404` | No such thing. |
| `409` | Conflicts with what exists — a name taken, or a system row that cannot be changed. |
| `422` | The request was understood and is not acceptable. |
| `429` | Rate limited. `Retry-After` says how long. |
| `503` | PostgreSQL or Redis is unreachable. `Retry-After` says when to try again; the request itself was fine. |

The `401`/`403` distinction is deliberate everywhere. Collapsing them tells a client to retry a
sign-in that cannot fix anything.

## Two refusals worth recognising

**Step-up required** — the token is valid but the sign-in is too old:

```http
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="insufficient_user_authentication", max_age=300
```

Send the person through `/oauth2/authorize` with that `max_age` and retry.
[RFC 9470](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9470).

**Silent check failed** — `prompt=none` could not be satisfied, returned to your redirect URI:

| `error` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `login_required` | Not signed in, or the session no longer satisfies what you asked |
| `consent_required` | Signed in, has not agreed to these permissions |
| `account_selection_required` | Needs to pick an account |
| `interaction_required` | Anything else needing a human |
