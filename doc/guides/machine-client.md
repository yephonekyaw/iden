# Add a machine client

For a backend that acts **as itself** — a nightly job, a kiosk, a service calling another service.
No person is involved, so there is nobody to redirect and nothing to consent to.

## Register it

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/admin/clients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "clientId": "attendance-sync",
    "name": "Attendance sync job",
    "clientType": "confidential",
    "allowedGrants": ["client_credentials"],
    "grantedScopeIds": ["<scope uuid>"]
  }'
```

Two things differ from a [web application](web-application.md):

- **`confidential`.** A machine client must keep a secret, so it must be able to. Anything running in
  a browser cannot, which is why public clients are refused this flow entirely.
- **`grantedScopeIds`, not `grantableScopeIds`.** These are permissions the client **holds in its own
  right**, not ones it may request on someone's behalf. The distinction is the whole difference
  between the two flows.

The response contains `clientSecret`, shown **once**.

## Get a token

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/oauth2/token \
  -u attendance-sync:$CLIENT_SECRET \
  -d grant_type=client_credentials \
  -d scope="attendance:records:write"
```

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 600,
  "scope": "attendance:records:write"
}
```

**No refresh token and no ID token.** There is no session to keep alive and no person to describe —
when the token expires, ask again. That is cheaper than managing rotation.

The `sub` of the token is the client itself, not a person. Your API should expect that: audit
entries attributed to `attendance-sync` are correct, not a bug.

## Rotating the secret

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/admin/clients/{id}/rotate-secret \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

The new secret is returned once and the old one stops working immediately. Deploy the new one first
if you cannot tolerate a gap — or register a second client and retire the first, which has no gap at
all.

!!! tip "Basic or POST body, your choice"
    `-u client:secret` sends HTTP Basic, which takes precedence. `client_id` and `client_secret` in
    the form body work too. Basic keeps the secret out of anything that logs request bodies.
